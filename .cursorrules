# Project Rules

## Session Continuity

Read SESSION_LOG.md at the start of every session for context.
Update SESSION_LOG.md at the end of every session.

## Development Conventions

### Git Workflow

- Branch naming: `claude/<issue-id>-<description>` or `david/<issue-id>-<description>`
- Conventional Commits with `Co-Authored-By` and `related-issues: TT-XXX`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, test
- Scope: descriptive word or phrase (not issue numbers)

### Pull Requests

- Never merge without code review
- Squash and merge strategy
- Reply to gemini-code-assist with `@gemini-code-assist` prefix
- Post summary table after addressing feedback

### Code Review

- CRITICAL/HIGH: must fix
- MEDIUM: evaluate
- LOW: fix if trivial
- No performative agreement — state the technical fix directly

### Worktrees

- Bare repo + worktree structure (`.bare/` + `main/`)
- Flat worktree directory structure (not nested)
- Copy gitignored files before removing worktrees

### Linear

- Team: Team Tacocat
- Update issues as work progresses
- Link related issues

### Environment Variables

- `.envrc` with direnv, `.envrc.example` committed
- Never commit sensitive data
